## Hardware recommendations

### Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX80

First of all, I want to make a recommendation for a Micro-Four-Thirds camera.

Price for the body is 400 €.

### Samsung ViewFinity S5 S50GC, 34"

I was using a Dell 28" TFT since 2015, bought from reading a recommendation from Linus Torvalds google+ blog, and I was pretty happy. But as the piece was more than 8 years old, it became defect. 

So I bought a new Samsung for 260 € which is really cheap. I am enjoying the bright colours and the wide screen, you can use many windows parallel.

### Logitech MX Keys

I fully can recommend this Bluetooth keyboard, because it is interoperabel with my iPad and my Lenovo notebook at the same time. 

Price is 90 €.
