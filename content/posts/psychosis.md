## A short story about psychosis

1. A neuron is an organic tiny piece of the brain. The brain consists of many of neurons. They are activated with a small electrical impulse. 
    
2. Everything is an inference. An inference is a conclusion that you draw about something by using information that you already have about it. (Nisbett et al)
    
3. When everything is an inference, also neurons and electromagneticity are inferences. So we are concluding, that there is something more complex than what we knew before.
    
4. But our brain knows nothing about reality. It predicts reality by using an electromagnetic feedback-loop paired with neurotransmitters, small messenger substances. (Feldman-Barrett et al)
    
5. Therefore our mind is fundamentally part of an inference we are using to explain reality. 
    
6. Our brain is creating our mind by using the inference of nothing by adding all the information it has collected today about anything.

7. Dreaming for example is a neuronal activity in which our brain uses the information collected in one day to plan our body’s resources for the next day. (Feldman-Barrett et al) If we can not plan within our resources, the resource budget is incomplete and instability and illness is the long-term consequence. 

8. If we set our brain under stress, it could produce more errors, as soon as this ‘unusual stress/information amount’ is not in its feedback-ed learning curve (Van Os et al).

9. If we have a perception full of errors, we could talk about a broken mind, or also the symptoms described by the term schizophrenia.

10. The medical approach of today is to reduce the amount of information produced by neurons or to slow down its processing speed by lowering the neurotransmitter dopamine, and to reduce the amount of electrical impulses fired by the neuron. (Häfner et al)

11. Conclusion is that the described illness could be a redundant learning-curve (or feedback-loop) of the brain.
