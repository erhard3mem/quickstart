## Think Python critics

I enjoy coding in python, and I read the book Think Python. So I want to make a few comments on it, because I think they could be missing or I never read some. First the book is very helpful and covers all the basics. But the examples are pretty abstract, so learning by doing is something else, because I don't know anybody who needs drawing of snowflakes in real life examples. This could be different, but as this is a book about the basics, this can be excused.
