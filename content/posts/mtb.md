## Introduction

I love bicycling, this is why I wrote this page. I don't like e-Bikes, because I think it is just a mass consumption hype of lazy or people in a hurry to stay dependent on electricity wherever you go and park. I prefer a non full-suspension mountainbike, and I went to mountainbike parks to drive it.
